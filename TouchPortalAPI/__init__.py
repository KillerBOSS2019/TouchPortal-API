## Python API and SDK for Touch Portal.

Easy way to build plugins for [Touch Portal](https://touch-portal.com) using Python.

Check the [source repository](https://github.com/KillerBOSS2019/TouchPortal-API/)
for latest version.

Please also refer to the [Touch Portal API documentation](https://www.touch-portal.com/api/)
on the Touch Portal site. Most of the documentation for this Python interface assumes at
least a basic understanding of how Touch Portal plugins work.


## Features

### TCP/IP Client

The core of the Python API is the `TouchPortalAPI.client.Client` class. This provides a
basic TCP/IP sockets-based client to interact with the Touch Portal desktop application
as the "server." It includes essential basic methods for exchanging messages between
TP and the plugin (send and receive), as well as many "convenience" methods for specific
types of messages (as defined by the TP API).

Messages from Touch Portal are delivered to the plugin script via event handler callbacks,
which can be either individual callbacks per message type, and/or a single handler for all
types of messages. The callbacks are executed in separate Thread(s), using a pool of up to
any number of concurrent threads as needed (if using more than one thread, the plugin
code itself is responsible for thread safety of its internal data).

### Runtime Tools

Also included are some utilities for possible use within plugins, found in the
`TouchPortalAPI.tools` module. These are mostly meant to be used during plugin execution
(vs. at development time like the SDK tools).

### SDK Tools

This project also includes some tools to facilitate plugin development, found in the
`TouchPortalAPI.sdk_tools` module, and available as a command-line utility.
Currently the main focus is on generating and validating the plugin definition JSON files
required for integration with TP. The primary goal being to remove the need to edit any
definitions manually, outside of the plugin's code itself, and reduce or remove the need
for repeating the same data in multiple places.


## Basic API Usage

More complete example(s) may be found in the code repository's
[examples folder](https://github.com/KillerBOSS2019/TouchPortal-API/tree/main/examples).

```python
import TouchPortalAPI # Import the api

# Initiate the client (replace YourPluginID with your ID)
TPClient = TouchPortalAPI.Client('YourPluginID')

# This event handler will run once when the client connects to TouchPortal
@TPClient.on('info')
def onStart(data):
    # `data` is a Python `dict` object created from de-serialized JSON data sent by TP.
    print('I am Connected!', data)

    # Update a state value in TouchPortal
    TPClient.stateUpdate("(Your State ID)", "State Value")

    # Or create a list with however many states you want and use this method to send them all
    updateStates = [
        {
            "id": "(Your State ID)",
            "value": "(The Value You wanted)"
        },
        {
            "id": "(Your 2nd State ID)",
            "value": "(The Value You wanted)"
        }
    ]
    TPClient.stateUpdateMany(updateStates)

# Action handlers, called when user activates one of this plugin's actions in Touch Portal.
@TPClient.on('action')
def onActions(data):
    print(data)

# This function gets called every time when someone changes something in your plugin settings
@TPClient.on('settings')
def onSettings(data):
    print('received data from settings!')

# Shutdown handler, called when Touch Portal wants to stop your plugin.
@TPClient.on('closePlugin')
def onShutdown(data):
    print('Received shutdown message!')
    # Terminates the connection and returns from connect()
    TPClient.disconnect()

# Connect to Touch Portal and block (wait) until disconnected
TPClient.connect()
```
